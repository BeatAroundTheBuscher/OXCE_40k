  STR_SECTOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Chaos Cults are the most dangerous of all the organisations that plot to overthrow the rule of the Imperium of Man from within. All planets and civilisations belonging to the Imperium can harbour Chaotic organisations, which themselves are as diverse in practice and membership as is imaginable. From the blood-soaked sacrificial cults of Feral Worlds to the philosophical secret societies of more advanced planets, the temptations of Chaos can capture all."
  STR_SNAKEMAN_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Traitor Guard is a term given to the vast majority of disloyal mortals who have left the Imperial Guard in order to fight for Chaos. They are not a single coherent force, but rather a faction of the infinite collection of warbands and hosts under the leadership of Chaos Champions and part of the The Lost and the Damned."
  STR_ETHEREAL_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "During the Horus Heresy, the terrible Imperial civil war that pitted the Battle-Brothers of the 18 known Space Marine Legions against one another, there were two factions. These were the Loyalist Space Marines who continued to serve the Imperium and the Emperor of Mankind and the Chaos Space Marines of the Traitor Legions who betrayed the Emperor and pledged their souls to the service of the four Ruinous Powers of Chaos."
  STR_MUTON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Chaos Terminator is a Chaos Space Marine who wears a suit of Tactical Dreadnought Armor (Terminator Armor) and serves as one of the Traitor Legions' most powerful infantry shock troops. Sundered and cast out from the Imperium of Man, having turned their backs on the Emperor of Mankind, the Chaos Space Marines of the Traitor Legions know that there can be no peace for them, no forgiveness nor absolution."
  STR_FLOATER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Chaos Space Marine Raptors are the dedicated assault infantry of the Chaos Space Marine Traitor Legions. Raptors consider themselves to be elite shock troops similar to the warriors who comprise the Loyalist Space Marine Assault Squads, although they are far more egotistical and self-centred. As Raptors are used to strike at the weakest point in an enemy line, this tactical usage has been expanded into an outright philosophy dedicated to the concept of preying on the weak."
  STR_CELATID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Plaguebearers are the footsoldiers of Nurgle's daemonic legions. These loathsome creatures are crafted from the blighted souls of mortals who have been slain by the virulent plague known as Nurgle's Rot. These Lesser Daemons of the Lord of Decay are shambling, pustulent creatures. They possess a single, cyclopean eye and a single horn rising above their haggard, drawn faces, their bodies covered in filth and parasites."
  STR_SILACOID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Bloodletters, also known as the Chosen of Khorne, the Warmongers of Khorne, Slaughter-kin and the Crimson Death, are Lesser Daemons (Khak'akamshy'y) that serve as the eager daemonic foot soldiers of the Blood God Khorne. As a host, they march as one, in formations with supernatural precision, but in battle, they try to outdo each other in ruthless acts of cruelty and savagery."
  STR_CHRYSSALID_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "All Daemonettes are inherent experts in peeling away the defensive walls that shield the desires of men and women as well as other, more alien beings from discovery. If a mortal seeks adoration, these Daemons know the words of seductive guile to speak into his ears to cause him to lower his guard. If that man wants nothing more than to be recognised above his peers, the child of malice knows how to sweetly praise him for his achievements. There is no buried dream, no subdued ambition that a Daemonette cannot uncover and exploit." #
  STR_REAPER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The Juggernaut's heavily armored, partially mechanical bodies are made of living metal and burning blood. They are said to embody the rawest moments of battle, where overwhelming force is prevalent and only the mightiest and toughest can survive. They have their pens within Khorne's realm, constantly fighting against each other and anyone who dares to approach them. Despite that, each of them has its flesh cut to form a saddle, supposed to become the steed of a mighty follower of Khorne."                                               #
  STR_SECTOPOD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "After the Heresy, knowledge behind the creation of the old Dreadnought patterns declined among the traitors. Little effort was made to maintain and replicate the Legion's more sophisticated wargear. Without the technology to protect them from the ravages of time, such as stasis tombs, and exposed to the malignance that had spread among the legionnaires, internment within a Dreadnought's sarcophagus became a living hell. Under the sway of Chaos, many fell prey to insanity and mutation."                                                #
  STR_CYBERDISC_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Daemons, also known as Neverborn, are entities of the Warp, and servants of the Gods of Chaos. They are created at the whim of a Chaos god from a fraction of the god's own power and act as an extension of their will. A daemon's appearance and character reflect the god's own nature. These daemons may be reabsorbed into the god at whim."
  STR_SORCERER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A Sorcerer is the most powerful type of psyker found among the Chaos Space Marines and the other Forces of Chaos, serving the same role as Librarians do for Loyalist Space Marine Chapters and Sanctioned Psykers do for the Imperial Guard, though many powerful Sorcerers can also be considered psychically-gifted Champions of Chaos. Instead of the subtle psychic manipulation and divination used by the Farseers of the Eldar or the strength-boosting powers of the Librarians, the Sorcerers of Chaos wield, the mightiest powers of the Warp."        #
  STR_LORD_UFOPEDIA: "A Champion of Chaos, also styled as a Chaos Champion, is an individual who has dedicated himself to further the cause of his particular patron Chaos God, or Chaos as a whole in the form of Chaos Undivided. He or she is either an extremely powerful warrior, including a Chaos Space Marine, or a psychic Chaos Sorcerer. Chaos is attractive for the simple reason that it offers enormous power to those willing to turn away from the light of the Emperor and dedicate themselves in body and soul to the Ruinous Powers."
  STR_XENO_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A Genestealer is a bioform of the multi-species Tyranid race that was genetically designed by the Hive Mind for the infiltration of other intelligent species' settled worlds. The Tyranids are an intelligent, nomadic alien race governed by a collective consciousness known as the Hive Mind and comprising many different genetically-engineered forms. Genestealers, like virtually all Tyranid organisms, are characterised by their six limbs and resilient carapace."
  STR_CARNI_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The Carnifex is a monstrous creature that essentially acts as an organic main battle tank for the Tyranid Hive Fleets. It is armed with the most advanced Tyranid Bio-Weapons and is used primarily as a shock trooper to carry out starship boarding actions, frontal shock assaults on entrenched positions and for besieging fortified locations or enemy armor formations. As Tyranids are constantly evolving their forces, many different species of the Carnifex exist. They have a thick carapace, which provides excellent protection from damage."
  STR_WARPTALON_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "A Warp Talon is a Chaos Space Marine Raptor whose long exposure to the Immaterium has corrupted his physical form, enabling him to move through the veil of reality and slice between dimensions. When a pack of Warp Talons emerges from the Warp, it appears to those on the battlefield below as if daemonic warriors have burst out from nothingness into fiery, vengeful life. Like the stuff of nightmares, they plummet downwards in an explosion of Warp fire, tearing into the foe with murderous intent."
  STR_OBLITERATOR_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "An Obliterator is a former Chaos Space Marine, often a former Techmarine, who is believed to have been affected by the so-called 'Obliterator Virus', a daemonic virus that transformed these once-loyal marine into bloodthirsty mutant weapons of Chaos. They are monstrous hybrids of human, daemon and machine. An Obliterator is able to absorb any weapon into its body that is held for too long. These unfortunates can spawn these weapons or ammunition from their very flesh. They are biologically fused to their suits of Power Armor."
  STR_KHRONE_TERRORIST_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Khorne Berzerkers are Chaos Space Marines dedicated to glorifying the Chaos God Khorne through brutal melee combat. Driven solely by their raging desire to spill blood and take lives, a Berzerker's sole purpose in life is to destroy their enemies in the name of the Blood God and take life in the most brutal fashion imaginable. Berzerkers refuse to use most forms of ranged weaponry and usually make almost exclusive use of close combat melee weapons, in particular the Chainaxe, as the axe is the favoured weapon of Khorne."
  STR_PRIEST_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The Cult priests have been acting in concert with the highest levels of the Traitors leadership. While some cult priests served as advisors in matters of prophecy and the Warp, others acted as high priests under whom multiple cult bodies could be gathered together. All were schooled in the darkest arts of Warpcraft and were able to call upon and wield the most terrible of Warp-born powers and aberrant psyker abilities, making them one of the most dangerous classes outside of the Traitor Legions."
  STR_BEHEMOTH_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "One of the most dangerous threats to our forces. Once a marine in a Centurion Warsuit, seduced by Slaanesh and bound in their corrupted armor."
  STR_GREYKNIGHT_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "The Ordo Malleus assumes our chapter wields the corruption of the Chaos Gods, so they have sent this mysterious Loyalist Chapter to eliminate our forces."
  STR_FLAMER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Flamers excel at leading assaults on defensive positions, since there is no fortification that can offer protection against their magical fire. They attack by unleashing roaring gouts of alchemical fire from their arms."                                               #
  STR_SCREAMER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "Screamers are very agile due to their ability of flight and possess a feral but cunning intellect. Though they are able to use magic-based attacks, their greatest weapons are their so-called Warp Jaws which allow them to chew through all kinds of solid matter, even the armoured hide of a space ship. In a direct confrontation there are few that can withstand their jaws or outrun their wings"                                               #

  STR_GENE_CULTIST_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Normal Humans who have been infected with the xenos genetic material of a Genestealer Patriarch through its ovipositor. This infection makes these people members of the cult's collective psychic Broodmind as well as the potential parents of a new generation of Genestealer hybrids. Brood Brothers appear completely Human despite their infection and so may be members of the local civil or military authorities, continuing to carry out their normal duties in their world's society"
  STR_GENE_SAB_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} An infected explosives expert.Their foul features go unnoticed in the underhives of many Imperial worlds. However, on closer inspection their alien form is revealed. They have heavily ridged heads, mauve to black skin, and may even hide an extra clawed limb under their tattered clothes."

  STR_NECRON_DESTROYER_AUTOPSY: "Necron Destroyer Origin"
  STR_NECRON_SCARAB_AUTOPSY: "Canoptek Scarab Origin"
  STR_NECRON_WARRIOR_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Necron Warriors are the primary infantry troops of the soulless, robotic Necrons. They were created from the majority of the Necrontyr people who agreed to be bound to the will of their Star Gods, the terrible entities known as the C'tan. The Necrontyr's consciousnesses were transferred into robotic bodies made of the living metal called Necrodermis. Over a long period of time, the new unliving bodies dulled the Necrontyr's minds and their abilities to feel emotion or pleasure."
  STR_NECRON_IMORTAL_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} The Necron Immortals are those favoured Necrontyr who were among the first to give up their flesh and embrace the necrodermis and their C'tan gods. For this, they were rewarded by being turned into Immortals. In life, Immortals were the professional soldiery of the Necrontyr empire. In death, they surpass the Warriors in nearly every way."
  STR_NECRON_DEATHMARK_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Highly-skilled snipers and assassins of the Necron forces, appearing from apparently nowhere and striking with terrible precision. The name is fitting: once given the hunter's mark, a Deathmark's targets are almost certain to meet their deaths scant moments later. Like most Necrons, the Deathmarks' technology lies far beyond the realm of human comprehension and they can effectively phase in and out of normal space-time at will."
  STR_NECRON_LYCHGUARD_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Elite protectors and emissaries of the Necron nobility. In order to serve as a bulwark against those who would harm their charge, gifted with the highest quality of living metal bodies, equal in resilience and power to those inhabited by the Lords and Overlords they protect. In addition to serving as wardens, Lychguards often act as messengers and envoys for their masters. In order to better serve in this capacity, the personality and intellect of the Lychguards was preserved through the process of bio-transference."
  STR_NECRON_DESTROYER_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Necron Destroyers are deranged agents of annihilation whose sole reason for existence is centred around an unshakeable yearning to quench the flames of life. A Destroyer cares not for borders or dynasty allegiance, nor does he make any distinction between the innocent and the damned, all life is his enemy, and all living creatures are his prey."
  STR_NECRON_SCARAB_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} A small, silver, beetle-like Necron construct. These robotic scarabs are the most numerous and diverse of the Necrons' Canoptek machine servants. They are designed to break down organic and non-organic matter into raw energy, which can then be woven into fresh construct forms at the direction of the scarabs' controller.."

They are merciless killers without exception, revelling in the hunt and the kill. When they launch their attack, they use shuriken pistols and scorpion chainswords."
  STR_DAVENGER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} The Dire Avengers are first amongst the Aspect Warriors of the Eldar. They represent the War God's unending thirst for vengeance upon a galaxy of woe, and as such they are merciless to their foes and unstinting in their devotion to their people."
  STR_ELDAR_REAPER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} The Dark Reapers are the most menacing of the Aeldari Aspect Warriors. They exemplify the Aeldari War God Kaela Mensha Khaine in his aspect as the Destroyer, and their skull-masked costume echoes that of their founder and Phoenix Lord, the Harvester of Souls, Maugan Ra. They specialise in the use of highly-destructive, long-range heavy weaponry."
  STR_WRAITHGUARD_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} The Wraithguard of the Craftworld Eldar are not living warriors; they are artificial robotic constructs called Ghost Warriors created from the complex psycho-plastic material crafted by the Asuryani of the craftworlds known as wraithbone.

  STR_BANSHEE_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} The Howling Banshees are the all-female Eldar Aspect Warriors who specialise in highly mobile melee combat and represent the Eldar War God Khaela Mensha Khaine's ability to instill fear in his foes. The banshee is a harbinger of woe and death in Eldar Mythology. Their cry is said to herald ill fate and can even wrench a soul from its Spirit Stone"
  STR_SEER_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} A Seer is a member of the Craftworld Eldar race who is currently following the Path of the Eldar dedicated to the development and extensive use of the Eldar's potent psychic powers beyond the innate psychic ability possessed by every Eldar."

  STR_ORK_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Orks are savage, warlike and crude, but they are one of the most successful species in the Milky Way, outnumbering possibly every other intelligent race, including Mankind. However, the power of the Ork race as a whole is limited due to the fact that they are split into hundreds of tiny empires, klanz and tribes, which are more often warring between themselves than not."
  STR_ORKARDBOY_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Elite specialist Ork Boy who is better armored and more skilled in combat due to his long experience compared to a standard Greenskin. These Ork warriors have survived many battles and equip themselves with a Karapace, the Ork version of Carapace Armor. These well-protected warriors often form the center of an Ork army."
  STR_ORKNOBBOY_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Serving as a crude Greenskin ruling class, the Nobz are never above reminding the Boyz who's in charge by making a few bloody examples. This could involve hacking up some suitably impressive foes, or knocking a few fractious Boyz's blocks off. The Nobz aren't too fussy, just so long as it gets the message across."
  STR_ORK_DREAD_AUTOPSY_AUTOPSY_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Grav Platforms are Eldar anti-gravitational platforms mounting heavy weapons crewed by a pair of Guardians.

  STR_UFO_POWER_SOURCE_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} This essential component, present in craft of all sizes, supplies power to the other components and subsystems. Power sources will often depend on consuming promethium as fuel, though on larger craft it will function to rout power from the craft's plasma generators."
  STR_UFO_NAVIGATION: "Warp Drives"
  STR_UFO_NAVIGATION_UFOPEDIA: "Once a spacecraft activates its Warp-Drives, it is plunged into a dimension very different from the material universe. It is convenient to imagine Warpspace as consisting of a relatively dense, almost liquid energy, devoid of stars, light and life as it is commonly known. Once within Warpspace, a voidship may move by means of its main Newtonian drives, following powerful eddies and currents in the Warp, eventually reaching a point in the Warp corresponding to a destination in realspace."
  STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION: "Ceramite Plates"
  STR_UFO_CONSTRUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Ceramite is a form of heat and shock-resistant ceramic material that is widely used throughout the Imperium of Man. High-quality ceramite is used in the higher-quality types of Imperial armor, including Carapace Armor, Power Armor and Terminator Armor. Ceramite conducts almost no heat, making it especially heat-resistant and effective protection against energy-based weapons. Low-quality ceramite is used to mass-produce cheap Flak Armor for the Imperial Guard."
  STR_ELERIUM_115: "Promethium"
  STR_ELERIUM_115_UFOPEDIA: "{NEWLINE} Promethium is a general term used for any form of combustible fuel in the Imperium of Man, including the various isotopes of hydrogen used as both fuel and reaction mass in Imperial Plasma Generators and starship engines. The term promethium also refers more specifically to the substance that is the 41st Millennium's equivalent of napalm, a highly volatile incendiary gel derived in part from refined hydrocarbons which immediately ignites on contact with oxygen and is used in Imperial Flamer Weapons."

  STR_ALIEN_FOOD_UFOPEDIA: "The main reason the never-ending tides of the Warp's madness is upon us. Those stones bring forth Daemons, creatures that can normally exist only within the Immaterium, unless certain conditions are met in the material realm. The Immaterium is what empowers the daemonic and mortal servants alike of the four Dark Gods."
  STR_ALIEN_REPRODUCTION: "Stasis Tombs"
  STR_ALIEN_REPRODUCTION_UFOPEDIA: "Essentially a time-warp generator, a stasis tomb creates breaches in the normal flow of space-time continuum within their area of effect, slowing down massively the progress of causality. The closer one is to the centre of the stasis-field, the slower time appears to move; a single moment can take so long to play out inside a stasis field that it appears frozen to observers outside the affected area. Because the contents of a stasis field are divorced from the normal passage of time, it is effectively impossible to alter the conditions of the inside of the field in any way."

The base is well hidden, and contains the warp stones responsible for the desolation of this planet. It also seems to contain another kind of warp stone, more powerful than all the others.
